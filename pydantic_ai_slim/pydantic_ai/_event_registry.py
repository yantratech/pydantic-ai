"""Registry-backed serialization for extensible event families.

Event classes like [`CustomEvent`][pydantic_ai.messages.CustomEvent] are open families: applications
and third-party packages define typed subclasses that must round-trip through the closed
`AgentStreamEvent` discriminated union. Like the native tools union (see
`AbstractNativeTool.__get_pydantic_core_schema__`), the family's inner tagged union is rebuilt from a
registry at schema-generation time, so registered subclasses validate to their own class. Unlike
native tools, an unregistered tag doesn't fail validation: it degrades to an "unknown" envelope
carrying the raw payload in `data`, which re-flattens on serialization so a downstream consumer that
does have the defining module imported recovers the typed event.
