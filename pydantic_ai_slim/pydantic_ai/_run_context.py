        non-deferred capabilities (`defer_loading` not `True`) plus the deferred ones the model has
        loaded, so `active_capability_ids - loaded_capability_ids` is the auto/always-on subset.

        Tools keep the word *available* because for them there is only one question — may the model
        call this now? — and no catalog sense to collide with. So `is_tool_available` reads "revealed,
        and its owning capability is active".

        Two axes, deliberately not mixed. *Configuration* is set once by the author: a capability is
        either **deferred** (`defer_loading=True`) or **always-on**. *Runtime* is derived per step:
        **loaded** records what the model asked for, **active** what is in force. So "always-on" is
        the antonym of "deferred", never of "active" — an always-on capability is always active, and
        a deferred one becomes active once loaded.

        Distinct from `capabilities`, the full registry (including deferred ones not yet
        loaded). See `loaded_capability_ids` for the subset the model explicitly loaded.

        Reliable from `before_run` onwards: the `capabilities` registry is seeded once at
        run start, and `loaded_capability_ids` is refreshed from history before each model
        request, so the loaded subset grows across steps as the model loads capabilities.
        Because it grows step by step, where you read it in the
        [hook order](../hooks.md#hook-ordering) determines what you see — e.g. a capability

        """Emit a custom or capability event into the current run's event stream.

        Application code emits an instance of an application-defined
        [`CustomEvent` subclass](../agent.md#custom-events) with typed payload fields.
        Capability hooks and capability-contributed tools instead emit a typed
        [`CapabilityEvent`][pydantic_ai.messages.CapabilityEvent].

        This method must be awaited, so it's available from async tools, capability hooks, history
        processors, and async output validators. Sync tools cannot emit events; write async tools instead.
        It's async rather than sync like [`enqueue`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.enqueue] because
        immediate dispatch (below) awaits listeners before returning, and because widening a sync
        signature to async later would break every caller.
        The event reaches the run's `event_stream_handler`,
        [`Agent.run_stream_events`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.run_stream_events],
        [`Agent.iter`][pydantic_ai.agent.AbstractAgent.iter] streaming, and the UI adapters.

        When emitted from within a tool call and the event doesn't already set a
        [`tool_call_id`][pydantic_ai.messages.CustomEvent.tool_call_id], the current
        [`tool_call_id`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.tool_call_id] and
        [`tool_name`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.tool_name] are stamped on the event in place so
        consumers can attribute it to the originating tool call.

        By default, capability and application listeners run when the event's stream position is
        consumed, and this method returns without awaiting them. For tool-execution emissions this
        happens before the next model request. An event emitted during `before_model_request` may
        reach listeners only after that request begins, with the same as-soon-as-possible timing as
        [`RunContext.enqueue`][pydantic_ai.tools.RunContext.enqueue]. That is a statement about *when*
        listeners run, not about order: every consumer sees events in emission order either way.

        A [`CapabilityEvent`][pydantic_ai.messages.CapabilityEvent] class declared with
        `dispatch='immediate'` changes one thing — listeners are awaited before this method returns,
        so the emitter can read decision fields they set (this is what makes a cancelable event
        possible). Everything else is the same: the event still takes the stream position it would
        have taken, the same listeners run in the same order, and it is delivered exactly once. What
        stream consumers gain is that they never observe such an event mid-decision — the stream waits
        for its listeners to settle before yielding it, so the values they read are final.

        Args:
            event: The [`CustomEvent`][pydantic_ai.messages.CustomEvent] or
